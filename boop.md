### Welcome to my Website!
Here is where I blog about all sorts of undertakings and projects (usually relating to robotics) and maybe talk about some strategies I use in games like TF2 or Age of Mythology.

### What kind of Robotics Experience do I have?
I've been doing robotics for about 9 years now, and the first platform I used to build was the LEGO Mindstorms NXT. I have competed in various robotics competitions such as FLL and FTC in the robotics team Iron Reign (http://www.ironreignrobotics.com). Some of the topics I know well (as applications in robotics) are PID and Gyros. I have one year of Java class and I am using Android Studio for FTC.
