<h3>Watching the 2017 Eclipse</h3>

<p>

On the morning of Sunday, August 20, 2017, my father and I got up around 4:00 AM in order to head out on a ten hour drive to Tennessee to see the 2017 solar eclipse inside the totality area. 
We left with three days of clothes each, our battery charging box, pillows and blankets, as well as Argos, our image tracking robot. The trip itself was relatively uneventful, except that during 
the first few hours of the drive, we saw the ISS flying across the sky as a bright white dot. After we arrived at the hotel, we went to a local Walmart to buy food, drinks, a chess set, a folding
 table and an inflatable to couch to sit in while watching the eclipse. <br>
The next day, the day of the eclipse we left around 9:00 AM for another two hour drive in order to reach as close to the center of the path of the moon's shadow as we could in order to get a full 
two minutes and thirty seconds of absolute totality. We arrived around 11:00 AM and spent the next few hours setting up the couch and table, playing chess and tuning Argos for its new platform. 
By the time C1 was reached, we were mostly set up to view the eclipse and we started watching on and off, snacking and playing chess in between. <br>
We noticed it getting slightly darker and darker, as well as the fact that shadows started getting sharper around the edges. At the point when about 90% of the sun was covered, ten or so minutes
before totality, we set up to watch when C2, the first point of totality, would occur. <br>
We happen to live in an extraordinary situation in the solar system, where we happen to, at this very moment, be at the exact distance from the sun and our moon such that they are the same size
in the sky, by complete coincidence. Seeing a total solar eclipse like this is a once or twice in a lifetime opportunity, and given the fact that the moon is gradually drifting away from the earth,
there will eventually be a point in time at which a total solar eclipse of the sun by the earth's moon will no longer be possible. It was completely worthwhile to see such a beautiful, rare celestial 
event, even if it took an 800 mile, ten hour drive just to see it for two and a half minutes.
