I have competed in various robotics competitions such as FLL and FTC in the robotics team Iron Reign (http://www.ironreignrobotics.com). Some of the topics I know well (as applications in robotics) are PID and Gyros. I have one year of Java class and I am using Android Studio for FTC. ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
